# How to contribute
We love contributions from everyone! There are only a few guidelines that we encourage contributors to follow so that we can accept and maintain third party  changes.

Notice that Calendula is licensed under the terms of the [GPL v3 license](LICENSE.md), so by submitting content to the Calendula repository, you release your work to the public domain.

Since this repository contains the code for an Android app published in Google Play, which could include part of your contributions in future updates, we’re required to have agreements ([CLA](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/citiususc/calendula)) with everyone who takes part. This is the easiest way for you to give us permission to use your contributions (in effect, you’re giving us a license, but you still own the copyright, so you retain the right to modify your code and use it in other projects).

## Getting Started

 * Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
 * Submit your issue (ensure the same issue does not already exists).
 * Try to clearly describe the issue, and include steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
 * Fork the repository on GitHub
 * Make sure you have signed our [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/citiususc/calendula)


### Making Changes

We follow the branching model proposed by [Vincent
Driessen](http://nvie.com/about/) on [this article](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), so we have two main branches: `master` and `develop`.

 * The `master` branch reflects the code of the latest version of the app available on Google Play.
 * The `develop` branch reflects the code of the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
 * Furthermore, when a development version (almost) reflects the desired state of the new release, a release branch is created. Release branches are usually deployed through the *Google Play BETA channel* before they are made available to everyone

Create a topic branch from where you want to work. This may be usually the `master` or `release` branch for bug fixes or `develop` for adding new features. Please avoid working directly on the master branch.

## I would like to contribute, but I'm not a developer...
Non-code contributions are also welcome!. You can do a lot of things:

 * Comment on a issue or start your own to suggest ideas or give your opinion.
 * Fix typos, comments or clarify language to improve the quality of the app.
 * Propose an icon, a better drawable for an specific action, or even a new material app logo ;-).
 * Be a member of the testing community by joining the testing group on Google Groups. You will automatically receive the updates from the BETA channel like normal updates from Google Play.

### Help with app translations
You can also contribute by translating the app to your (or other) language. All you need to do is:

 * Add a new folder named `values-{LANG}/` at `Calendula/src/main/res/`
 * Translate all the `strings_*` files inside
 * Send a pull request. PR are preferable, but you can also send us the translated files and we'll do the rest.

You can also Contribute with a better translation for a particular word or sentence.
